//! `cargo xtask trapped`: no toolkit-free file hides in the front-end crate.
//!
//! A file belongs in the engine when it names no toolkit, and the gate says so
//! outright: nothing may be left (`docs/architecture.md` § Layers). It counted
//! against a committed number while the moves were still ahead; the number is
//! gone with them. What may stay is allowlisted, and each of those is the front
//! end's own: its root, its glyph table and its dial labels.
//!
//! Only `src/` counts. `tests/` and `examples/` are harnesses: a test binary's
//! root names no toolkit and never will, and no engine should hold it.
