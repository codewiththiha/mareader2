//! What a page's AI run sees above it, and what only the front end answers.
//!
//! A run works from [`AiView`], one pane's document as of the last frame, and
//! shows what it is doing as a [`Pill`]. Two things it cannot know itself: how
//! a pane's pages read now, which [`Views`] answers, and how many tasks at once
//! the attached model takes, which [`Models`] answers. Both are the front end's
//! to give, so a run takes them as traits and never names a window.
