//! The engine's own files: what it writes, where, and how often.

//! A front end hands the session a directory and never writes to it. What

//! files and the same repair notes (`docs/architecture.md` § Layers). A
//! platform with no files keeps the same two, by the same names and in the same
//! bytes: [`blobs`] hands them over, and [`parse`] reads them back.
