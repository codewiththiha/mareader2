//! The machine the engine runs on, and the places it has.
//!
//! [`Host`] is all the engine asks of a machine: where its own two files live,
//! where files that can be built again live, the clipboard, the file manager,
//! and the system's own opener. An app answers it — the platform on a desktop,
//! a browser's own table on the web, [`Fake`] in a test. Nothing here names a
//! toolkit and nothing here starts a thread: how a machine does a thing is
//! that machine's business (`docs/architecture.md` § Layers, Law 6).
//!
//! [`Machine`] is what a front end reads back: the places the services it
//! still holds are wired to, each a child of one of the host's two folders.
