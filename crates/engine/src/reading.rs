//! Where a pane is in its document: the reading half of a view.
//!
//! This is what a reopened window and a headless client both need — which
//! page, how far through, the book it reads as, how it is turned. The
//! geometry a front end needs to draw it (scroll offsets, laid-out rects,
//! textures) and the ids of what is selected stay above the line.
