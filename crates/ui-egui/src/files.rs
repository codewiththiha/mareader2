//! The open dialog and dropped files; results arrive later as commands.
//!
//! A dialog belongs to the machine, so a front end only asks for one:
//! [`Dialogs`] is answered by `apps/mareader` over `rfd` on a helper thread, by
//! [`Browser`] where a page has no paths to show, and by [`Quiet`] in a test,
//! which refuses, so the toast that says so is what a reader gets. Law 6 keeps
//! the engine out of all three: what comes back is a command with a path in it.
