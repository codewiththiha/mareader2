//! The desktop's file dialogs: what the front end asks, this thread runs.

//! A dialog belongs to the machine, so it lives here and not in the front end:
//! `files` says what it wants in words, and this answers over `rfd`, on a
//! thread that keeps the window drawing while a picker is open. What comes back
//! is a path, which the front end turns into the engine command that asked.
