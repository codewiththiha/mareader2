# Architecture

> **Status:** M0 (foundation) · **Last updated:** 2026-10-13

mareader2 delivers what mareader does — the same features, the same reading
experience, the blend backdrop, panes, appearance, library and study tools — as
one native Rust process: egui for the interface, wgpu for drawing, hayro for
PDF and parley for EPUB.

It is a rewrite, not a port (ADR 0005). mareader is the specification of *what*
the app does. *How* is designed fresh for egui: much of mareader's structure
exists to work around a browser (iframes per pane, a frame transport, reactive
signals, DOM measurement, pdf.js memory latches) and has no reason to exist
here.

## Layers

Lower layers never see egui. `cargo xtask layers` enforces this from
`xtask/src/layers.rs`, which also lists planned crates so a new crate lands in
the right place.

| Layer | Crate (`mareader-…`) | State | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | `appearance` | **exists** | base mode, tint, texture, grain, presets; colour maths; the page filter chain as matrices |
| L0 | `workspace` | **exists** | the pane split tree (≤ 4), layout, dividers, drop edges |
| L0 | `fetch` | **exists** | resumable downloads from mirrors, checked by kind before kept; desktop only, empty in a browser |
| L0 | `audio` | **exists** | a book's narration: clips decoded (symphonia), brought to the device's rate, sped up at the same pitch, and played on the system output (cpal); also samples a voice made in memory, queued behind what plays; silent in a browser |
| L0 | `memory` | **exists** | freed heap handed back to the system when the app is quiet (`malloc_trim` on Linux, pressure relief on macOS, nothing on Windows, which returns it already); the one small audited `unsafe` file for it; used when caches rest and when a voice model unloads |
| L0 | `script` | **exists** | a book's scripts in a sandboxed JavaScript engine (Boa) over a small page model: elements, events, timers, form controls; pages written back as markup; desktop only |
| L0 | `kokoro` | **exists** | a small neural voice: Kokoro-82M's inference ported to candle, phonemes in and 24 kHz speech out, chunked at pauses, its noise seeded so equal text sounds equal; weights read from the downloaded PyTorch file or a GGUF build (16- or 8-bit, widened on load), voices from their PyTorch files; Kitten's smaller models of the same design read straight from their ONNX files (full or 8-bit; weights named by the module using them, sizes read off their shapes) with Kitten's alphabet and voices file; credits in its `NOTICE`; desktop only |
| L0 | `g2p` | **exists** | English text to the phonemes Kokoro was trained on: misaki's pipeline ported (spaCy's tokenizer, a part-of-speech tagger, the misaki lexicons, numbers, and a small neural model for unknown words); phonemes also written for people, as IPA or an easy respelling; its data downloads with Kokoro or as the pronunciation pack; credits in its `NOTICE` |
| L0 | `ipa` | **exists** | text in other languages to the IPA Kokoro's voices read, by our own spelling rules with no data to download: Spanish (Castilian), Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, French and Hindi, with stress, links between words (French liaison too), the `a` Hindi leaves unsaid, and numbers in words; written as espeak-ng writes it, so the voices hear what they were trained on, and checked against it on CI |
| L0 | `hanzi` | **exists** | Chinese text to the IPA Kokoro's Mandarin voices read: the reader Kokoro-82M was trained with, reimplemented (numbers to numerals, jieba's word cut with its model for unknown words, pypinyin's readings by phrase, then misaki's pinyin-to-IPA table with tones as arrows); its dictionaries download from pinned commits and load in about 20 MB; checked against misaki on CI; credits in its `NOTICE` |
| L0 | `vits` | **exists** | Piper's VITS voices: inference ported to candle and read straight from each voice's ONNX file (weights named by the module using them, convolution shapes from the graph), so every quality and multi-speaker voice loads with no tables; misaki's phonemes respelled the way espeak writes them for each voice; noise seeded so equal text sounds equal; credits in its `NOTICE`; desktop only |
| L1 | `speech` | **exists** | reading text aloud: sentences cut from page text with their page and character spans, and the engines behind one `Voicer` trait (the system's own voices through `tts`; local models, Kokoro, Piper and Kitten, behind one engine that asks each only to load a voice and say a line, their sentences made a few ahead on a thread, the one wanted now in a short first piece so it sounds sooner, kept up to a set size, and played without gaps; a model loads on first use, says so while loading, and leaves memory after a set idle time; a silent one for tests); voice models on offer, each in builds of several sizes that share its voices (or, like Piper, voices that bring their own weights; or, like Kitten, builds that bring every voice, a file two builds share kept once), the build picked for the first download and more added or removed later, downloaded one at a time through `fetch` and checked by SHA-256, a file another model already has linked rather than fetched; a file several voices share, such as the Chinese dictionaries, fetched with the first and kept until the last goes; each model's own settings, such as Piper's expression and rhythm, as shares of each voice's normal; the pronunciation pack the word cards use, a shelf of its own beside the voice models, sharing their files both ways; desktop only |
| L1 | `pdf` | planned M2 | hayro: open, page sizes, tile raster, text and glyph boxes, outline, links, search index |
| L1 | `reflow` | planned M4 | styled blocks → parley lines → pages; typography knobs; hit-testing |
| L1 | `library` | planned M5 | books, locations, shelves, sources, scans (`docs/library.md`) |
| L1 | `study` | planned M6 | dictionary packs, CEFR levels, gloss requests and marks |
| L1 | `dict` | **exists** | dictionary packs: download with mirrors and resume, parquet → SQLite, card lookups, search, bridges through English; downloads and lookups need the desktop |
| L1 | `cefr` | **exists** | word levels: the CEFR dataset (download, parquet → SQLite), which words of a text are hard, a clicked word's role from the tagger; downloads and answers need the desktop |
| L2 | `epub` | planned M4 | rbook container, spine, ToC, XHTML+CSS subset → `reflow` blocks |
| L2 | `settings` | planned M1 | the persisted schema and defaults |
| L3 | `session` | planned M2 | open documents shared by panes, the tile cache, the job scheduler |
| L3 | `assist` | **exists** | AI tasks and their prompts, the providers behind one `Backend` seam, API keys (`docs/assist.md`); desktop only, the one exception to rule 3 |
| L7 | `ui` | **exists** | egui: theme, icons, title bar, panes, every view and popover |
| — | `apps/mareader` | **exists** | the window and `main` |
| — | `xtask` | **exists** | gates |

The rules:
1. A crate depends only on lower layers. Same-layer edges need an entry in
   `SIDEWAYS`.
2. egui, eframe, winit, wgpu and rfd appear only in L7 and the app.
3. L0–L3 compile for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. A gate for this arrives with the
   first L1 crate.

## How the app is built in egui

egui is immediate mode: every frame, the UI is a function of the state. Write
it that way rather than as a web app in egui syntax.

**State.** One owner, `MareaderApp`, holds plain structs: settings, the pane
tree, the open documents, the library, which popover is open. Domain state lives in
the L0–L3 crates and has methods and tests of its own. egui's `Memory` keeps
only transient widget state (scroll offsets, hover animations, a text field's
cursor). There are no signals, effects, observers or stores, and no state is
mirrored in two places.

**Views are functions.** A view takes the state it shows and a `&mut Commands`:
`fn show(ui: &mut Ui, state: &T, out: &mut Commands)`. It draws and pushes
`Command`s (`crates/ui/src/command.rs`) for what the user asked. It does not
mutate app state, call other views' handlers or keep its own copy of the data.

**Commands are the only way to change state.** Buttons, menus, shortcuts and
drops all produce the same `Command` values, and `MareaderApp::apply` is the
one place they take effect, after the frame's UI pass. So a shortcut and its
button cannot drift apart, and every user action can be tested by pushing a
command.

**Frame order.**
1. `logic`: apply settings changes (restyle, motion switch), drain finished
   background jobs into state.
2. `ui`: panes, then the floating chrome (title bar, popovers, toasts) above
   them, each pushing commands.
3. Apply the commands.

**Use egui's tools, not re-creations of browser ones.**

| Need | egui tool | What mareader needed on the web |
|---|---|---|
| Sidebar, slide in and out | `egui::Panel::left(..).show_collapsible` | CSS transitions, layout observers |
| Popovers, menus | `egui::Popup`, `Ui::menu_button`, `Response::context_menu` | a floating layer, outside-click and Escape wiring |
| Settings window, confirmations | `egui::Modal`, `egui::Window` | modal components, focus traps |
| Tooltips | `Response::on_hover_text` | a tooltip component |
| Long lists and grids (thumbnails, library) | `ScrollArea::show_rows` / `show_viewport` | the `virtual-list` crates |
| Drag and drop inside the app | `Ui::dnd_drag_source` / `dnd_drop_zone`, `Response::dnd_*` | a custom pointer-drag engine |
| Files dropped from the OS | `ctx.input(|i| i.raw.dropped_files)` | Tauri drop events |
| Shortcuts | a keymap table of `KeyboardShortcut` → `Command`, `InputState::consume_shortcut` | key listeners per component |
| Theme | `Style` and `Visuals`, set once per appearance change | CSS variables |
| Animation | `Context::animate_bool_with_time` / `animate_value_with_time` where motion helps | CSS transitions on everything |
| Text layout in the chrome | `LayoutJob`, `Galley` (truncation, wrapping) | DOM measurement probes |
| Accessibility | AccessKit, through `WidgetInfo` on custom widgets | ARIA |

Stock widgets (`Button`, `Slider`, `ComboBox`, `Checkbox`, `TextEdit`) are
styled by the theme and used as they are. A custom widget is written only when
egui has nothing close (caption buttons, page views, library cards); it reads
its colours from `Tokens` or `Visuals` and gives AccessKit a label.

**Repaint is demand-driven.** Every deferred thing schedules its own wake with
`request_repaint_after` (the title bar's hide grace, a toast's time line); worker
threads call `Context::request_repaint` when a result is ready. Nothing polls,
and an idle window renders no frames.

**Persistence.** Settings and the library are serde structs written through
eframe's storage or our own file with an atomic rename, debounced, off the UI
thread for anything large.

## The page pipeline: every page is a texture

A page from either format ends up as GPU textures that one compositor draws.
`docs/adr/0003-pages-are-textures.md` gives the reasoning.

```
PDF:  hayro → RGBA tile ─┐
                         ├─▶ TextureHandle (LRU, capped) ─▶ page pass (wgpu callback)
EPUB: parley → vello_cpu ┘                                    filter · blend · texture · grain
```

- **Raster off the UI thread.** A small worker pool renders tiles at the
  settled scale. During a zoom, the existing texture stretches and is replaced
  once, crisp.
- **The page pass** is an `egui_wgpu::CallbackTrait` paint callback (M3). It
  takes `Appearance::page_filter()` as a ≤ 7-entry matrix uniform
  (`MAX_FILTER_OPS`) and `page_blend()`, and composites the texture tile and the
  grain. `apply_filter` in `crates/appearance` is its CPU reference, and tests
  compare the two. Appearance values are uniforms, so dragging a control
  re-renders no page (`docs/design.md` § How the theme works).
- **Blend backdrop** (PDF): the dominant paper colour of the whole page or its
  edges is sampled from the raster, and the pane background takes that colour
  so the page melts into it.
- **Text overlays are geometry.** Selection, search hits and gloss marks are
  rectangles from the page's glyph index (hayro text extraction or parley
  clusters), painted over the texture.
- **Grabbing empty space pans.** A drag begun off the text lines and links
  (margins, gutters, pictures; word gaps count as text) scrolls the pane
  both ways with a hand cursor. A release while still moving flings it on,
  slowing to a stop; any press halts it. A click there acts as before.

### Scrolling long documents

mareader2 scrolls 10,000-page files at low memory with no virtual-list
crate. The rules:

- **Layout from page sizes alone.** Page rects come from the document's page
  boxes, never from rendering. `ScrollArea::show_viewport` allocates the full
  content height; each frame draws and requests only the pages meeting the
  viewport plus a small prefetch window. A test opens 10,000 pages and checks
  that demand is the visible pages plus prefetch.
- **Visible work is always admitted.** Byte and count caps limit prefetch and
  what stays cached; the viewport already bounds what is on screen, so a
  visible page is never left blank to honour a cap.
- **Whole pages first, tiles only for huge rasters.** hayro interprets the
  whole page for each tile, so a page renders as one
  raster until its long side passes ~4096 px. Past that, a ≤ 2048 px backdrop
  plus at most four tiles per side, the tile side growing with zoom.
- **Hold tiles while panning.** New tiles are requested only after the scroll
  offset rests for ~0.25 s; meanwhile the backdrop or older tiles show,
  stretched. A drag never queues one interpret per frame.
- **Demand first, results bounded.** Each frame publishes its demand before
  receiving. A result no longer in demand is dropped before it becomes a
  `ColorImage`. Finished results wait in a bounded queue (~32 MiB, 32 items).
- **Upload budget per frame.** At most ~8 results, ~16 MiB or ~4 ms of texture
  uploads per frame, so a burst of finished tiles never stalls scrolling.
- **Stale stays until replaced.** Textures of an old zoom are drawn stretched
  until the sharp ones cover the page, then evicted.
- **Text layers are lazy.** Glyph data is extracted on the first selection or
  search, cached by count separately from rasters.
- **Touchpads scroll 1:1.** Precise wheel deltas bypass egui's easing
  or the page lags the fingers on Windows.
- **Colours never re-render.** Appearance is uniforms of the page pass, not
  a recolour while rasterising, so a colour change re-renders nothing.

## EPUB

EPUB replaces mareader's txt and md formats. `docs/epub.md` has the plan and
ADR 0002 the decision: rbook reads the container, a small XHTML+CSS subset
becomes styled blocks, parley lays out and paginates them, and vello_cpu (the
rasteriser hayro uses) draws page textures. Every mareader typography setting
has a parley equivalent.

## Threads and resources

- **UI thread:** egui only. It never blocks on I/O or raster work.
- **Workers:** raster, parse and scan jobs run on threads and report over
  channels. Each result carries the document id and generation it was made
  for; a result for a closed pane, an old zoom or an old document is dropped
  before it is uploaded.
- **File watch** (`crates/ui/src/watch.rs`). One thread looks at the open
  files' size and modified time every second, and wakes the window only once
  a change has held for two looks; the window stays idle meanwhile. The file
  opens again on the workers and replaces the old document when it is ready:
  a book lands on its reading place, a PDF on its page and scroll. A file
  unreadable mid-save keeps the old one until the next change.
- **One document, many views** (ADR 0006). A book opens once into an
  `Arc<Document>` held by the documents table; a pane holds only its view
  (document handle, scroll, zoom, selection). Two panes on one book share the
  parse, the glyph index and the tiles.
- **One cache, one budget, one pool.** A single byte-capped tile cache keyed by
  (document, page, scale, tile) serves every pane. One worker pool takes jobs
  in priority order: visible tiles in the active pane, then other visible
  tiles, then prefetch. Jobs carry a generation, so a superseded one is skipped.
- **Teardown is ownership.** When the last view of a document closes, its
  `Arc` drops, its pending jobs are cancelled and its tiles leave the cache. A
  test proves the texture count returns to the baseline.
- **Caps everywhere.** Tile cache capped by bytes, thumbnails by count, and the
  glyph index built on the first search, not at open.
- **Memory claims need measurements:** what was measured, how, the workload,
  before and after, and known limits, recorded in `docs/memory.md`. The starting
  baseline: at 150 %, native hayro peaked 12–118 MiB above baseline, about
  3–15× less than pdf.js on light files and 2–4× less on heavy ones. That run
  was in Node, not a webview, so the comparison is indicative only.

## Window chrome

- **macOS:** full-size content view, title hidden, native traffic lights.
- **Windows and Linux:** `with_decorations(false)`, our own caption buttons in
  the platform's style, and 5 pt resize edges.
- Behaviour: `docs/design.md` § Title bar.
