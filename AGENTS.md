# AGENTS.md

These rules bind every AI agent and every human contributor in this repository.
They come before any task, instruction or deadline. `CLAUDE.md` holds the
day-to-day working instructions; if the two disagree, **this file wins.**

## Project

mareader2 is a native rewrite of [mareader](https://github.com/codewiththiha/mareader)
(Tauri + Leptos + pdf.js) in Rust with egui and wgpu. The goal is every one of
mareader's capabilities — reading, panes, blend, appearance, library, study
tools — in a codebase that is smaller, faster, leaner on memory and easier to
maintain. It reads PDF (hayro) and EPUB (parley); EPUB replaces mareader's txt
and md formats.

- **Parity is functional** (ADR 0005). What a mareader user can do, they can
  do here, with equivalent settings. Pixels, timings and code structure are
  not part of parity.
- **The look is ours:** `docs/design.md`, starting from mareader's and free to
  improve.
- **Feature tracking:** every capability has an entry in
  `parity/mareader-features.toml`, checked by `cargo xtask parity`.
- **Architecture:** `docs/architecture.md` (read § How the app is built in
  egui before writing UI). Decisions: `docs/adr/`.

## The reference checkout

mareader is checked out beside this repository as `../mareader` (or at
`MAREADER_DIR`). It is read-only reference for *what* a feature does.

- **Rebuild from the goal, not the code.** For each feature, work out what the
  user gets and which edge cases matter, then design the smallest native model
  that delivers it (`docs/porting.md`). Don't port module layouts, workaround
  layers or web-only mechanisms; `docs/porting.md` § What not to port lists
  them. Don't add mareader's crates as dependencies.
- **Check claims about mareader against its source.** When a doc, test or
  parity note says "mareader does X", grep `../mareader` first. Memory has been
  wrong here before.
- **Read the comments and tests around a mareader feature.** They record the
  regressions it paid for; keep the ones that still apply to a native app.
- **Improve freely, drop deliberately.** A better design for the same outcome
  needs no permission; note it in the feature's doc. Removing something users
  rely on is the owner's decision.

## Assets

An asset is any non-code material the project ships, embeds or shows: icons,
images, fonts, sounds, sample documents and screenshots.

- Allowed licences only: MIT, ISC, BSD-2/3-Clause, Apache-2.0, OFL-1.1, CC0-1.0,
  CC-BY-4.0, or contributor-original under the project licence.
- **Every asset has an entry in `ATTRIBUTION.toml`:** path or crate, author,
  source with version, SPDX licence and SHA-256 for files. `cargo xtask assets`
  fails on an unlisted file, a wrong hash or a licence off the list.
- **Stock icons are Lucide**, compiled from build-only declarations into typed
  geometry behind `crates/ui-egui/src/icons/` (ADR 0004). Code names an `Icon` by
  meaning; only `icons::pack` names a glyph. Custom provider and voice marks
  remain the documented static-SVG exceptions.
- **Fonts:** Inter in `assets/fonts`. A new face needs an OFL source and an
  `ATTRIBUTION.toml` entry. Never bundle a system font.
- If an asset's origin or licence is unclear, do not add it; ask the owner.

## Never crash

Every PDF, EPUB, settings file, drag payload and keystroke is untrusted. None of
it may crash the app or lose the user's place. In non-test code:

- No `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, `unreachable!` or `todo!` unless provably
  infallible, with a comment saying why.
- No indexing or slicing with input-derived positions: use `get`, and slice
  strings only at char boundaries.
- Checked or saturating arithmetic on input-derived numbers. Guard division by
  zero and NaN or infinite casts (`f32::NAN.clamp(..)` stays NaN).
- Cap allocations sized by input; bound recursion with depth limits. EPUB adds
  zip bombs, deep XML, path escapes and huge images to the list.
- No `unsafe`: the workspace denies `unsafe_code`. The owner allowed six
  exceptions: `apps/mareader/src/traffic_lights.rs` and `open_files.rs` for
  AppKit; `crates/speech/src/mac_voices.rs`, which asks which listed voices
  have their sound; `crates/memory/src/lib.rs`, which hands freed memory
  back on macOS and Linux; and the twins `crates/kokoro/src/simd.rs` and
  `crates/vits/src/simd.rs`, which run a loop's AVX2 build only once the CPU
  is found to have AVX2 and FMA. `cargo xtask unsafe` fails if any other file
  allows it.
- Every crash fix gets a synthetic regression test.

## Layering

`cargo xtask layers` enforces the table in `docs/architecture.md`.

- The workspace is engine-first: `crates/engine` (`mareader-engine`, L5) is the
  app without a window, `crates/ui-egui` (`mareader-ui-egui`, L6) is one front
  end in egui, and the binaries at L7 hold a session and draw.
- Every crate marked Core in `xtask/src/layers.rs`
  never depends on egui, eframe, winit or wgpu. They are testable without a
  window.
- Only the front layer (`crates/ui-egui`) draws. `apps/mareader` only opens the
  window, and `apps/mareader-cli` may link no toolkit at all.
- `cargo xtask wasm` holds rule 3: every L0–L5 crate, the front end and the web
  app compile for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. `assist` is the one declared
  exemption, and it says why.
- A file under `crates/ui-egui/src` that names no toolkit belongs below the
  front end. `cargo xtask trapped` counts those files; the count in
  `tools/trapped_count.txt` may only fall, and only the slice that moves them
  lowers it. `tests/` and `examples/` are harnesses and are not counted.
- A new crate gets a row in the layer table in the same commit.

## Shape: one job per file, reuse before writing

### File and function size

- New files stop at 500 lines, tests included. Existing oversized files have
  ceilings in `tools/shape_baseline.toml`; they must not grow.
- Ceilings only go down; only SZ tightens the baseline. The declared data files
  in its `[exempt]` section are exempt; adding an exemption is an owner decision.
- New functions stop at 80 lines. Baseline functions must not grow.
- Move inline test modules over 150 lines into `foo/tests/<topic>.rs` files
  under 500 lines. Tests cited in the parity ledger stay at their paths.
- Matches over 12 arms for commands, options or properties only route to
  functions in child modules.

### Splitting and reuse

- Keep `foo.rs` as the facade; put private children under `foo/`. Split by
  responsibility, and use `pub(super)` at most for moved internals. The
  public API stays unchanged. Aim for a facade of at most 200 lines.
- Move-only commits do not rename items, alter signatures or change behavior;
  behavior changes follow separately. Avoid modules named `utils`, `helpers`,
  `misc` or `common`, except `tests/common/mod.rs`.
- Search for existing helpers first and consult `docs/reuse.md`. The commit body
  records the search. Reuse existing logic; extract on the second use. Do not
  add speculative type parameters, traits or options without two real callers.
- Shared feature code lives under its feature, cross-feature UI code under
  `crates/ui-egui/src`, integration fixtures under `tests/common/mod.rs`, unit
  fixtures in `src/test_support.rs`, core logic in the lowest shared crate, and
  parity-tool code in `tools/parity-kit`. A new L0 crate needs owner approval.
  Index each shared item in `docs/reuse.md`.
- Delete dead code in the same commit. Avoid argument-forwarding-only functions
  and one-field types without an invariant.
- Commits changing more than 50 lines need a body describing what, why and
  verification. A `perf` commit records command, machine, before and after.
- `python3 tools/shape_check.py` checks tracked file and Rust function sizes;
  `--dups` reports matching bodies after the duplicate-removal slices. Its
  lightweight scanner is not a Rust parser, so review its results and rules
  it cannot enforce, including inline tests and routing matches.

## Code style

- Rust: default rustfmt (`max_width = 100`); clippy clean with `-D warnings`.
- Comments: see `### Docs and comments` below. It is a constraint, not an argument.
- No `TODO`/`FIXME`, no scaffolding for work not being done now, no
  speculative abstractions. A planned feature lives in the parity file, not as
  an empty function.
- One owner per responsibility. No duplicate state, no permanent
  compatibility layers, no unbounded fallbacks.
- No per-frame, per-page or per-scroll logging.

### Docs and comments

Docs (`///` items and `//!` modules) state contracts. The first line is one
sentence within 80 columns; after a blank doc line, item docs may use 12 lines
and module docs 20. State invariants, units, failure cases, ordering and at most
one example. Public core items need a first line; a private function under ten
lines gets at most one. Docs must not exceed the item they document. A
`comment-check: allow` marker on a doc is a reviewer-visible claim.

Ordinary comments are one line, at most 80 columns and 15 words, with no allow
marker. A diff earns one `//` line per 25 added code lines, with a floor of two;
a function has at most three. Comments state constraints code cannot show.
Remove narration, history, justification, restatement, filler, dividers,
commented-out code, TODOs and FIXMEs. Put reasoning in docs or commit bodies.
`tools/comment_check.py` checks blocks and `tools/comment_budget.py` checks a
diff; pass changed files explicitly. Review the rules the tools do not enforce.

## Resource rules

- Everything that allocates has an explicit owner and teardown: textures,
  render jobs, worker threads, caches, file watchers, timers. Dropping a view
  is not teardown unless the owner's `Drop` releases it.
- Closing a pane or a document releases everything it allocated: page
  textures, tiles, the document handle, its search index.
- Job results carry the document id, generation and zoom they were made for;
  stale ones are dropped at the channel edge, never uploaded.
- Every deferral has a guaranteed wake (`request_repaint_after`, a channel
  message, a timer); nothing may wait on an event that might not come. An idle
  window renders no frames.
- PDF pages render blank until the full-resolution raster lands; no
  low-resolution placeholders (mareader's rule).
- Caches are capped by bytes or entries, never unbounded.
- Memory claims need measurements: what, how, workload, before and after, and
  known limits. Record them in `docs/memory.md`.

## egui, natively

The UI is immediate mode. Write it as egui code, not as a web app in egui
syntax (`docs/architecture.md` § How the app is built in egui).

- **State lives in plain structs** owned by `MareaderApp` or by L0–L3 types.
  No signals, stores, observers or effects; no state mirrored in two places.
  egui `Memory` holds only transient widget state.
- **Views are functions** that take the state they show and push `Command`s.
  They never mutate app state directly; `MareaderApp::apply` is the one place
  commands take effect. Buttons, menus, shortcuts and drops share commands.
- **Use egui's containers and widgets:** `Panel`, `Popup`, `Modal`, `Area`,
  `ScrollArea::show_rows`, `Sides`, `Button`, `Slider`, `TextEdit`, drag and
  drop via `dnd_*`. Write a custom widget only where egui has nothing close,
  and give it an AccessKit label.
- **Every modal is a `modal::Dialog`:** centred, one card, one backdrop, with
  the shared heading, switch card and buttons. Never call `Modal::new`
  directly; a test fails if anything else does.
- **The theme is `Tokens` applied to `Style` and `Visuals`,** once per change
  (`docs/design.md` § How the theme works). Views don't pick colours or sizes;
  custom widgets read `Tokens`. Appearance changes show on the next frame and
  never re-render pages: page looks are uniforms of the page pass.
- **Don't recreate per-pane isolation.** A pane is a view over a shared
  `Arc<Document>`, one tile cache and one worker pool (ADR 0006).
- **Animate meaning, not decoration.** Hover is instant; motion goes through
  `motion::secs` so the Animations switch can turn it off.
- **Never block the UI thread.** I/O, parsing, raster and scans run on workers
  that report over channels and call `request_repaint`.

## Always checkable

Phases are never "done before visible". The owner checks work while a phase
is in progress, by looking and by using it.

- **Slice vertically.** Each slice adds one thing a person can see or do,
  end to end (model, view, command, test), and lands on `main` on its own.
  Don't stack invisible plumbing for a whole phase and reveal it at the end.
- **`main` always runs** on the desktop (`cargo run -p mareader`). This is a
  desktop app; a slice that breaks it isn't finished.
- **The browser preview is a viewer, not a target.** `tools/web.sh --serve 8080`
  runs the same `App` so the owner can look and click from a sandbox. It is
  best effort and has no CI job. Never shape desktop code for it: when a
  desktop-only piece (threads, mmap, file watching, the library database)
  doesn't build for wasm, stub it in `apps/mareader-web` or let the preview
  lag.
- **Every state is reachable by name.** New views get a `set_option` key, so
  the shot tool (`key=value`) and the browser preview (`?key=value`) can open
  them directly.
- **Be honest in the app.** A control whose effect lands in a later phase says
  so in a muted line, and its parity entry stays `partial` with notes.
- **Log each slice** in `ROADMAP.md` (what to try, where).

## Parallel slices

- Each slice owns the exact write-set in `docs/slices/BATCH.md`. Write-sets in
  the same batch must be disjoint. Stop and report required outside edits.
- Shared registries have one writer per batch; see the batch table. S0 is the
  opening slice; SZ alone tightens the baseline and folds slice reports into
  ROADMAP and `docs/reuse.md`.
- A slice reports what changed, what was verified, limits and seen-but-untouched
  issues in `docs/slices/<id>.md`; do not edit ROADMAP during parallel work.
- Branch parallel slices from S0 and do not merge or rebase another slice into
  them. Each slice must stand alone and keep parity evidence addresses intact.
- No drive-by edits. Moves and behavior changes are separate commits.

## UI work: look at the result

- **Every UI change is looked at, not assumed.** Render it with
  `cargo run -p mareader-ui-egui --example shot -- OUT.png key=value…` (see
  `CLAUDE.md`), open the PNG, and check it against `docs/design.md`: light,
  dark and one tint, wide and narrow, and each platform's chrome the change
  touches. Say what was checked.
- **Behaviour is tested with egui_kittest** (`crates/ui-egui/tests/`): hover, click
  and keyboard through AccessKit labels, at 60 fps steps
  (`with_step_dt(1.0 / 60.0)`).

## Review every update, at four zooms

Not an end-of-task pass: a habit per update, so a defect is never built on.

- **Clause:** checked arithmetic, `get()` not `[i]`, char-boundary slicing,
  `<` against `<=`, the 0-based/1-based page seam, points against pixels.
- **Function:** is it total? Name an input that panics; walk empty, zero, max,
  malformed. Is the return type honest?
- **File:** two sources of truth, dead code, is the public surface smallest,
  is the doc comment still true?
- **Project:** layering, teardown, idle frames, egui idioms, the parity entry
  and `docs/design.md` still true.

## Testing

- Never weaken an assertion or edit `.github/workflows/` to make a check pass.
  If one blocks the task, report the blocker.
- **Prove a test fails before the fix by reverting the fix.** A test nobody has
  seen fail is not evidence.
- Tests mirror the zooms: unit in the crate, integration in `tests/`, kittest
  for the shell.
- Document runtime changes cover open → use → close, close during a render,
  rapid open/close/reopen, reader ↔ library, several panes, and stale results
  after close.
- Reuse mareader's test cases where the behaviour is the same; cite them in
  the parity entry.

## Parity, honestly

- `shipped` means it exists and a test proves it: `evidence` cites
  `path::test_fn` in this repository, and the test exercises the feature, not a
  neighbour of it.
- `partial` and `dropped` say in `notes` what is missing or why.
- Update the entry in the same commit as the feature. A status that became
  untrue is a bug.

## Gates

The gates, wherever they run:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy -p <crate> -j 2 --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test -p <crate> -j 2
cargo xtask layers && cargo xtask wasm && cargo xtask trapped
cargo xtask parity && cargo xtask assets
cargo xtask comments
```

Scope local builds and tests to the crates you touched, under a `timeout`.
The workspace sweep is CI's job. **Where** the gates run is chosen once per
session, below, before anything compiles.

## Session start: choose where the gates run

Do this first in every session, before any `cargo` command, and again after
anything that may have reset the machine. Sandboxes are wiped without
warning: assume no build cache, no env vars and no running watcher survived.

1. Run `python3 tools/ci.py mode`. It prints `local`, `cache` or `ci`, the
   reasons, and the exact next commands. Precedence, highest first:
   1. the user's explicit word ("use CI", "build locally", "use the cache");
   2. `MAREADER_VERIFY=local|cache|ci`;
   3. detection: RAM, cores, free disk, x86_64 Linux, a GitHub token.
2. Say the mode and why in the first report, for example
   "Mode: cache. 1.9 GiB RAM, 2 cores, token present, cache 3 commits back."
3. Follow that mode's loop below until the user changes it.

| Mode | Picked when | Compiles here | Tests and runtime errors | Waits on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `local` | >= 8 GiB RAM, >= 4 cores, >= 10 GiB disk | everything, scoped | here | nothing until final |
| `cache` | low-end, but x86_64 Linux, a token, >= 6 GiB free | scoped clippy and fmt, on CI's restored build | the CI quick gate | quick gate, then final |
| `ci` | anything else (no token, no disk, not Linux) | nothing | the CI quick gate | quick gate, then final |

### The two CI profiles: quick while developing, full at the end

- **Quick** runs on every push to a `<type>/<slug>` branch. It is one job,
  `Check / fmt, clippy, test`: fmt, shape, comments, commit subjects,
  `clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`, then the
  xtask rules. Every step runs even after an earlier one fails, so one push
  returns every problem at once: formatting, warnings, compile errors and
  failing tests. wasm, each-commit, macOS and Windows show as *skipped*.
  Skipped is not red. `Plan / profile` is a 5-second bookkeeping job.
- **Full** adds `Rust / wasm`, `Build / each commit`, `Build / macos-latest`
  and `Build / windows-latest`, all run to the end. It runs for pull
  requests, `main`, the schedule, a head commit whose message contains
  `[ci full]`, and `python3 tools/ci.py final`.
- **Dev loop:** push, then `python3 tools/ci.py watch`. It exits at the quick
  verdict: 0 green, 1 red (with a digest of every failing step), 2 still
  running. Fix the problems, push again, and watch again. A newer push
  cancels the older quick run. Use `watch --detach` and `watch --tail` for
  long waits, and never sleep-poll the API yourself.
- **Final:** once the slice is done, run `python3 tools/ci.py final`. It
  dispatches the full profile on the branch head, waits for **every** job,
  and prints a per-job table with all failures. Merge into `main` only on a
  green final, or on a green pull-request run. Don't run final for each
  small change: that brings back the 25-minute loop.

### Local mode

Run the gates here, push when green, and **don't poll the quick gate**: it
repeats checks that already passed. Run `ci.py final` before merging. A
Linux machine cannot check macOS, Windows or every commit on its own.

### Cache mode: CI builds, this sandbox resumes from it

CI packs a lint build of the workspace (`Cache / sandbox` → `Remote / sandbox
cache`, about 1.2 GB) after every green quick run, on every branch. The
sandbox downloads it and compiles only what changed since.

Run at the start of each session, and before the first `cargo` command
after any pause:

```sh
python3 tools/ci.py cache status    # 0 ready; 1 prints the one NEXT command
python3 tools/ci.py cache restore   # idempotent: downloads only if missing or partial
source /home/user/.cache/env.sh     # in every new shell, before any cargo command
```

- **Paths are part of the cache.** Clone at `/home/user/mareader2`. The cache
  lives in `/home/user/.cache/{rustup,cargo,target-mr}`.
- **The env is part of the cache.** Cargo hashes `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1`,
  `CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG=0`, `CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=0`, `CARGO_HOME`,
  `RUSTUP_HOME` and `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` into every fingerprint. A shell
  without `env.sh` silently rebuilds everything, which takes about 30 min.
  `eval "$(python3 tools/ci.py cache env)"` does the same as sourcing it.
- **Wiped again?** `status` says "none here" or "partial". Run `restore`
  again; it replaces a partial cache by itself. Never delete
  `/home/user/.cache` yourself.
- **What runs here:** `cargo fmt` and scoped
  `timeout 900 cargo clippy -p <crate> -j 2 --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
  which takes about 30 s on a fresh cache. The cache holds lint builds only.
  Tests and runtime errors come from the quick gate. Use
  `cache build --full` (5.6 GB, 23 GB unpacked) only when the owner asks.
- **Freshness:** `restore` picks the live cache closest behind HEAD. If
  `status` says stale (more than 30 commits), lint in CI instead. After the
  next green push, the refreshed cache arrives in 2–8 min; then run
  `cache restore --force`.
- **Fallback:** if restore fails (no token, no disk, no network), switch to
  CI mode and say so.

### CI mode

Compile nothing locally. Run the cheap checks: `comment_check`,
`commit_check` and `cargo fmt --check` if rustfmt is installed. Then push,
`watch`, and fix; at the end, run `final`. Take screenshots with
`python3 tools/ci.py shots`, never with a local wasm build and browser.

### CI discipline

- Install `tools/hooks/pre-push`. Never knowingly push a failure you can see
  locally.
- Read the whole digest before a fix push. It lists every failing step;
  fix them all in one push.
- **Caches.** `Check` saves `shared-key: linux` on pushes, both main and
  branches; an exact hit on main's cache skips the save. Other jobs save
  on main only. Never add sccache: on 2026-11-10, 15,310 sccache entries
  filled the 10 GB budget and evicted every Rust cache, so every job
  compiled ~300 dependencies (Windows 24 min, test 14 min). Never key a
  cache on a commit SHA. Changing the toolchain, `Cargo.lock` or any
  `CARGO_*` variable in `ci.yml` invalidates every key: do it on purpose, in
  its own commit. `Cache GC` (from `main`) sweeps dead refs and sccache
  leftovers daily.
- Report a warm quick gate over 12 min. Keep timing claims measured in
  `docs/verification.md`. Install apt packages through `.github/actions/apt`.

## Commits and pull requests

- Conventional commits: `type(scope): summary`, imperative, lower case, no
  trailing period, subject ≤ 50 characters — GitHub's own truncation sits near
  72, so 50 is what survives a log line, a UI row and a checklist cell intact.
  Enforced rather than remembered: `python3 tools/commit_check.py --install`
  writes a `commit-msg` hook that refuses an over-long subject, and
  `python3 tools/commit_check.py --range main..HEAD` audits history. The hook
  is per checkout, so a fresh clone installs it once; `--status` reports
  whether it is armed — git skips a non-executable hook in silence.
- Every commit builds alone, so `git bisect` never stops on a broken one:
  a change spanning crates lands in one commit, or in an order that builds.
  CI's `Build / each commit` job runs `cargo check` on every pushed commit.
- A squash merge makes the **PR title** the subject and appends ` (#NN)`, so a
  title must fit 50 characters *after* that suffix: 43 for a two-digit number.
  Check the merged form:
  `printf '%s (#12)\n' "$title" > /tmp/m && python3 tools/commit_check.py /tmp/m`.
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`,
  `chore`. Scope is the area touched (`shell`, `panes`, `pdf`, `epub`,
  `appearance`, `library`, …).
- One coherent change per commit; context goes in the body, not the subject.
  No progress reports, phase labels or ticket numbers in the subject.
- Work on a branch named `<type>/<slug>` and merge into `main` through a PR
  once CI is green. Commit only green states.
- Squash fixups before pushing; rewrite remote history only with
  `git push --force-with-lease`.
- Never commit credentials, tokens or personal documents.

## Definition of done

1. The change is implemented, and looked at (shots) if it touches UI.
2. The gates pass, the quick gate is green, and the full profile
   (`python3 tools/ci.py final` or the pull-request run) is green for the
   pushed SHA.
3. Docs describe the current behaviour: `docs/design.md` for the look,
   `docs/architecture.md` for structure, `docs/memory.md` for memory, and the
   parity entry for status.
4. Every added comment passes the diff-blind test (`### Docs and comments`) and
   `python3 tools/comment_check.py` is clean on the files the round changed.
   The round that adds a rule also applies it in the same round.
5. The summary states what changed, what was verified and any limits. If a
   requirement cannot be met, report the blocker instead of dropping it.
